"""
A Python 3 library for the analysis of data produced by AMIGA's Halo Finder (AHF).

For more information visit https://github.com/BenDavisonPetch/ahfhalotools

The majority of analysis is done via the ahfhalotools.objects.Cluster class. For
examples on usage, there are example scripts available at:
https://github.com/BenDavisonPetch/ahfhalotools/tree/main/examples
These scripts are provided without data, as the files are large and can't go
on GitHub.

Documentation is available in two places: the first is as docstrings within the
code, which can be viewed using the built-in ``help`` function:

    >>> from ahfhalotools.objects import Cluster
    >>> help(Cluster)
    Help on class Cluster in module ahfhalotools.objects: ...

The other way to view documentation is in a web browser at:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenDavisonPetch/ahfhalotools/main/docs/ahfhalotools/index.html
